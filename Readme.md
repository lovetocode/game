             OutLine for computer mayhem

You are a digurntled office worker who cant take it anymore. You sit all day in front of your computer
doing nothing and then you come home and sit in your computer until its time to go to be and do
everything over again. And you are tired of it. The game takes place at the protagonists condo. You

The object of the game? is to have fun. I thought about adding a points for hitting object.
But, I think a better thing would be to Have a time limit for the user in each room with a certain
about of computers she has to destroy to move on to the next room. I will go with that. How
would I determine when a computer/laptop is destroyed. I think I will have objects be work a 
certain amount of points and have a certain amout of points mean a laptop is destroyed.
